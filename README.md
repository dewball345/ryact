# Ryact: a react-like framework to build super-fast web apps in python.

![Lighthouse Metric](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30184788/118049818-288d8780-b333-11eb-9566-da231efcfd16.png)

This project was started by dewball345.

Ryact is similar to react, with components and state. The main difference, however, is that Breact doesn't have a virtual dom; instead, each stateful element (element that uses setState) is assigned a unique id and is retrieved and changed(by dom-diffing) when necessary. There isn't much that I have added - just the bare minimum, for now. The source code is around 300 lines of code, including the pre-built hash router. You can find the tutorial at: https://dev.to/pixari/build-a-very-basic-spa-javascript-router-2k4p

Ryact is powered by [rapydscript](https://github.com/atsepkov/RapydScript).

Installation
------------ 
The repo is set up so that you can clone it. You can install it by doing ```git clone https://github.com/dewball345/ryact```

If you haven't already, here are the steps in install RapydScript.

Type:
```
npm install rapydscript -g
```

Once, you have both cloned the repo and installed rapydscript, navigate to the directory and type:

```
rapydscript execute.pyj --output example/public/index.js --import_path ryact;example --beautify --es6
```

to view an example page

or type

```
rapydscript execute.pyj --output main_code/public/index.js --import_path ryact;main_code --beautify --es6
```
to see the output of your development code. 

Features
-------- 
1. üêç The most obvious: Use python(rapydscript, which shares the same syntax as python) instead of javscript
2. ‚öõÔ∏è Work with a component-based system with state-management when developing SPA's
3. ‚ú®Use preexisting libraries like bootstrap, tailwind, and more!
4. üî• Create webpages that are blazing fast

Usage

Directory Structure
-------------------
These are the main directories you should worry about
```
example/
‚îú‚îÄ some .pyj files
‚îú‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.js
main_code/
‚îú‚îÄ main.pyj
‚îú‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.js
ryact/
...
```
the main_code directory is where you type your, well, main code, and the example folder has an example of an app made with ryact. 

Caveats - When to use this vs Breact
----

| Breact  | Ryact |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Designed for easy development  | Designed for speed; development may be harder  |
| Full python syntax  | Mostly python syntax, but some things, like: casting, lambdas, etc. may not work. Check the rapydscript documentation for more info  |
| Super slow speed  | Blazing fast code |
| Code is not precompiled in advance, and supports live reload | Code is precompiled in advance, which makes things faster; you have to run the compile function before seeing changes|
| You can use custom python modules | you cannot use many custom python modules |

Choose Wisely.

Homepage - Ryact vs Breact

Ryact:
```
def homePage():
    thing = cre(
        "div",
        {
            "class":
            "container-sm d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center",
            "style": css({"min-height": "100vh"}),
        },
        [
            cre(
                "h1", {
                    "innerText":
                    "Ryact: A super-fast python library for single page webapps",
                    "class": "text-center"
                }),
            cre(
                "code", {
                    "innerText": '''
            #Ryact can be thought of as a continuation of Breact. The main difference is that Ryact is more than 10x faster
            #than its sister framework, but with most of the features still avaiable.
        ''',
                    "class": "text-center m-2"
                }),
            cre("h2", {
                "innerText": "Sample Apps",
                "class": "text-center m-2"
            }),
            Link('/counter').render(
                cre("button", {
                    "class": "btn btn-primary m-2",
                    "innerText": "counter"
                })),
            Link('/stls').render(
                cre(
                    "button", {
                        "class": "btn btn-primary m-2",
                        "innerText": "stateless widget example"
                    })),
            Link('/todo').render(
                cre("button", {
                    "class": "btn btn-primary m-2",
                    "innerText": "todo list"
                }))
        ])
```

Breact
```
def homePage():
    return group(DIV(Class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center", style={
        "height":"100vh"
    }), [
        H1("Breact: A python library for single page webapps", Class="text-center"),
        P('''
            This app was coded in python in Breact. Look in the inspector, and you will see
            <br>
            <code>&lt;script src="text/python" &gt; </code>
        ''', Class="text-center"),
        H3("Sample Apps:"),
        Link("/todo").render(BUTTON("Simple Todolist", Class="btn btn-primary m-2")),
        Link('/quiz').render(BUTTON("Small Quiz", Class="btn btn-primary m-2")),
        Link('/playground').render(BUTTON("A Little Playground", Class="btn btn-primary m-2")),
        Link('/router-playground').render(BUTTON("Router Playground", Class="btn btn-warning m-2"))
    ])
```

Api Calls in Ryact
-----
Api Calls are supported. You can use the fetch api, which is supported in rapydscript. 

Here are two ways to do this:

1. Using the .then() function in javascript
```
def apiCallThen():
    result = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1').then(
        def(result):
            result.json().then(
                def(mjson):
                    print(mjson)
            )
    )
```
2. Using the asyncSequence() function from ryact
```
def apiCallSequence():
    def a(): return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
    def b(result): return result.json()
    def c(json): print(json)
    asyncSequence([a, b, c])
```
